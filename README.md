## Instructions (for now)

Install Postgres, and create a database called "csci39547-server"

Create a .env file, save it inside the repo folder, and create a variable named `LOCAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD='somePassword'`, where `'somePassword'` should be replaced by the password of the "postgres" user in Postgres

Run `npm run dev` in terminal to start the server
